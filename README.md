# review-recognition

This is a training model which makes use of the IMDB database of 50000 movie reviews and reading their reactions. 

Based on this we have used Scikit-Learn to train the model with an accuracy of 84% and then we have improved it using GridSearchCV and confuse matrix. 

We have made use of Pandas to handle data. 

Just clone it and use it. 

Hoping to make more such projects :))
